A ML model for stock trading and predicting the best stock to invest in.
Stock Investment Prediction with LSTM
This repository contains code that demonstrates how to use LSTM neural networks to predict the best stock to invest in among three popular stocks: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX). The code utilizes historical stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance and preprocesses the data by calculating daily returns and normalizing the values.

The LSTM model is then built using the Keras library, consisting of two LSTM layers followed by a dense layer. The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset. The predictions are made on the test set, and the stock symbol with the highest predicted value for each day is identified as the best stock to invest in. Additionally, the overall best stock to invest in is determined based on the most frequent occurrence in the predictions.

This code serves as a starting point for developing an investment prediction system using LSTM networks and can be customized for different stocks or extended to include additional features and analysis. It provides a practical example of using deep learning techniques for financial forecasting and can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in applying LSTM models to stock market prediction.
